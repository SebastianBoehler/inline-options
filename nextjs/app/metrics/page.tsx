    interpretation: [
      "Higher values mean the product can absorb larger price swings before knocking out.",
      "Values below about 1 indicate the corridor is tight and even moderate volatility may breach it.",

      "Sigma ↓ = ln(Price / LowerBarrier) / (sigma * sqrt(T)) and Sigma ↑ = ln(UpperBarrier / Price) / (sigma * sqrt(T)). sigma is the annualised volatility estimated from the last 20 sessions and T is time to maturity expressed in trading years. When sigma is zero the app treats in-corridor products as very safe (50) and others as zero.",

Results are clamped to the [0, 1] interval.",

    key: "expected-profit",
    title: "Exp Profit",
    summary:
      "Expected payoff in absolute EUR assuming the product redeems 10 EUR when it survives the corridor.",

      "Positive values imply the survival payoff outweighs the entry price on average.",
      "Pairs naturally with Exp Return to communicate scale as well as efficiency.",

      "Expected percentage return based on the same survival probability assumption.",

      "Provides a capital-efficiency view of the expected payoff relative to the entry price.",
      "Helps compare products with different absolute prices.",

Rp, Dp, Bp, Vp and Tp are min-max normalised versions of potential return, minimum distance to either barrier, Bollinger band width, 95% option VaR and days until expiry. Pfactor = 1 - Offer / max(Offer) rewards cheaper entry prices.",

    summary:
      "Optimised blend emphasising survival probability and expected return while penalising tail risk.",
    interpretation: [
      "Always lives between 0 and 1 because each ingredient is normalised within the current dataset.",
      "Favours products that combine high Prob Stay with solid expected returns and reasonable distance to barriers.",
    ],
    calculation:
      "Opt Score = 0.45 * Prob + 0.3 * ExpRet + 0.15 * Sigma + 0.1 * (1 - Vp). Prob, ExpRet and Sigma are the min-max normalised versions of Prob Stay, Exp Return and the tighter sigma distance; Vp is the normalised option VaR so lower risk (smaller VaR) increases the score.",

    summary:
      "Legacy heuristic (\"Opitz formula\") combining potential return, entry price and technical stability.",
    interpretation: [
      "Higher when the payoff is large relative to the offer price and when the underlying trades in a tight Bollinger corridor with low VaR.",
      "Acts as an additional cross-check next to the newer Score and Opt Score columns.",
